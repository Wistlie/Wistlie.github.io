		---> Hey there! Welcome to my website! Here, you can view and learn things about me,
		such as learn about my hobbies, or my skills! Right now, I've taken a 
		passion to computer science, and am enjoying the challenges 
		the come along with it. Some of my hobbies include biking, running,
		drawing, programming, and my personal favorites 
		are quidditch and melee, both of which you 
		can view more about <a href="#quidditch">below!</a> <br />

		<em> <Strong> Personal Hobbies </Strong></em><br/>
		
		Perhaps the thing that has driven me to study computer science has been my dedication to melee. Every since I was a kid, 
		melee has been the most fun game I've ever played. For those that don't know, melee is a fighting game starring some famous 
		nintendo characters. Ever since its release, the scene for the game has been growing exponentially, with fans creating new ways 
		to play and win the game by analyzing the game down to the frame-by-frame data. I was inspired by the dedication, and have 
		joined the fanbase with the hopes to one day contribute my coding skills and help develop future melee projects.<br />
		<hr/>
		Along with melee, I have found the utmost joy playing Quidditch. No, not the flying-around-on-a 
		-broomstick-in-the-air-version of Quidditch, silly, I mean the run-on-land-with-a-broom-stuck-between-your-legs Quidditch 
		we magic-less muggles play. I play as a beater, who in the game is a person who throws balls–called bludgers–at players 
		to make them temporarily leave the game. This gives my teammates opportunity to score! Teamwork is essential in this game
		by the way;
		coordinated teams that blend their players together tend to win more games. I know that isn't much, but if you'd like, learn more with this
